Aim for 250mg DHA daily through food or pediatrician-approved supplements. This supports the 23% improvement in working memory shown in recent research. Practical examples: serve grilled salmon on Tuesdays and Fridays, or add 1 tablespoon of ground chia seeds to morning oatmeal daily.",

Schedule screen time in one block (e.g., 4-5pm) rather than throughout the day, and turn off all screens 60 minutes before bedtime.
